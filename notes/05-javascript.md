# JavaScript

## Monday Lecture Notes with Jeremy

'alt' + 'shift' + 'down' will copy the selected line of code and paste on the line(s) below.

The HTML script tag goes on the last line of the body

To test if the JavaScript file is working, use console.log().

Three ways to declare a variable
1.  let
2. const - cannot be changed. Main way to declare a variable.
3. var (not really used anymore because of scope)

For string interpolation, use backticks ``.

&& to check two conditionals
|| to check if one of the two conditionals are two.

NaN = not a number
Example: 'Jeremy' - 7 = NaN

console.group()
"will group everything inside."
console.groupEnd()


function is a piece of code that can be reused.

log + tab will create a console.log()

Putting a function inside of the function will run an endless loop
 
Hitting control + click (on a js function) will take you to the function in question.


## Tuesday Lecture Notes with Mick

Reference Data Types:
1. Array - store data by position (index) (also called lists, set)
2. Objects - store data by Key:Value pairs (great for storing mixed data types) (also called dictionaries, maps)


putting "defer" in the script tag will allow for the javascript to load last. This is useful when you want to put the script tag in the head instead of the bottom of the body. 
Example: <script src="app.js" defer></script>

Note: Arrays can hold other arrays.
Technically arrays can hold multiple data types, but this is considered bad practice.


Primitive data type are not shared. Reference data types are shared.

When we "reference" Reference types (copy them, use them) it will point back to the original
When we "reference" Primitive types, they create new data of the same value.

Looping is great for searching through an array.

"control + /" will comment out multiple lines at once.

.toFixed() will have the decimals out to a certain point 
For example: total.toFixed(2) would allow the number to round to the 2nd decimal.
