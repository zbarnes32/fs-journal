 Secret with MDI icons
    mdi-spin will spin the icon

section.container-fluid will create <section class="container-fluid">

aspect-ratio: 1/1 will make in image the same width and length
object-fit: will help fit the picture

Try to use min-height instead of just height when creating a section. 

Bootstrap has a card component that can be used as a placeholder for a card. Super useful when planning and getting something on the page. 

inside an <a>, href attribute on a tag -> target="_blank" will create a new tab on click instead of replacing the main tab. 

You can add breakpoints on flex. For example, d-md-flex would display flex once it hits the midpoint of medium. 

d-none is essentially display: none;

:root {
    --sasuke-purple: #60679E;
