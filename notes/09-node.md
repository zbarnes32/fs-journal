# Node

## Monday's Lecture Notes with Mick

In Mick's example, Node.js is the island and Express.js is the castle on the island. The knight is the HTTP Request.

Express.js is a JavaScript library. 

Using node template in BCW CREATE.

The BaseController creates the door
The super is the class that you extended from. 
for example: 
    export class CatsController extends BaseController {
        constructor(){
            super('endpoint')
        }
    }
