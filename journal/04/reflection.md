# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Overall, I'm feeling a little better about MVC which is nice since I wasn't feeling that way a week ago. This week's lectures and the material we have been introduced to doesn't seem too difficult to grasp, however each of the labs have taken me longer to do so I have only gotten a little practice on the new material. Given that we have a week to complete it, I'm not stress about the upcoming checkpoint like I was last week, but I still have this uneasy feeling that I'm going to struggle with this checkpoint. My hope for this upcoming week is to complete the checkpoint (obviously), and to revisit the lab assignments that we did this week to work on solidifying my understand of the material up to this point of the class.
