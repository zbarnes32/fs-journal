# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Asyncronous allows tasks to run simultaneously, while synchronous is dependent meaning that the operation prior has to complete before the next one. 

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener is a function in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur then responds to it.

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > A higher order function is a function that accepts a function as an argument and/or returns a function as its value while a callback function is function that's passed as a argument to another function.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > A promise is an object that will produce a single value some time in the future. A way to capture an error from a promise is a try/catch.

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > An HTTP request is made out of three components: request line, headers and message body.

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application Programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > Use async in front of the function.

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > Encapsulation provides the basic property to hide data, thereby providing security to user data.

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?
