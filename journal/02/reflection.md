## Prompts
- What went well this week?

### Week Two Reflection
Overall, the week was a little bit of a mixed bag. Felt like I had a real handle on JavaScript (at least what we have been taught) during the lectures, but struggled when I got out in lab. I might be a little hard on myself, but after spending time trying to teach myself before starting at CodeWorks, and this week, I thought I would be further along than I currently am. Even though I might be disappointed in my personal development, I feel like I've made strides this week. I really enjoyed all of the lectures and labs and having us build games has helped me understand the JavaScript a little more. I think my comfort level with JavaScript will come with time and practice. Although I'm nervous for the checkpoint, I'm also excited for the challenge and the projects I can make moving forward.
