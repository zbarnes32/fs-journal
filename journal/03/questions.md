# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > The pillars of object-oriented programming are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > Export allows you to export multiple, reusable components while export default only allows for an export of a single value as the default export. 

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > A way to restrict the direct access to components of an object.

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > It allows you to create an object that can be used in place of the original object, but which may redefine fundamental object operations like getting, setting, and defining properties.

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > A class is a type of blueprint that you can use to make objects, whereas an instance of a class just refers to an object's relationship to its class. 

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > A computed property allow you to create object properties dynamically using an expression in square brackets.

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  >  The MVC allows for a separation between the software's business logic and the display. This separation of roles provides for a better division of labor and overall improved maintenance. 

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > The controller takes action from the user. It allows draws to the DOM.

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > The service is where the business logic happens. Anything that modifies the data is handled in the service. 

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > The model acts as a blueprint of what the data in the AppState will look like.
