# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


If I'm being honest, things haven't really "clicked" like they have in previous weeks. Going into the week one and week two checkpoints, I was nervous, but confident that I would be able to complete the task at hand. I don't know if that was because I had a previous background in HTML/CSS and some basic JavaScript from my time before CodeWorks, or if I just understood the material more than I have this week. I no longer have that confidence going into this week's checkpoint. 

Having said all of that, even though I'm nervous and unsure if I will know all of the solutions to the upcoming requirements that the checkpoint will have, I can't help but feel excited for the upcoming challenge. I might be singing a different tune once I start tackling the checkpoint, but there is something about facing a challenge and not knowing all of the answers that excites me. This will sound weird, but I feel like if I'm able complete this challenge without having a full grasp of all of the concepts, I will take another step towards becoming a developer. 

When I started this journey of becoming a developer, my focus was to try and learn a language because I thought in order to solve the many problems that developers would face when working on a project, they would solve those issues because they just knew the programming language really well. Since I had that thought in mind, when I went the self taught route, I would focus on reading, taking quizzes, and solving puzzles that would focus on certain concepts. When it was time to work on a project, I decided to skip them in order to learn more concepts so I could "gain" more knowledge about a programming language. What I learned by going this route was that those concepts wouldn't stick and when I tried to start a project, I would struggle mightily. 

Now that I'm here at Boise CodeWorks and we work on projects on a daily basis, my knowledge (and my confidence) have gone up. Something else that kinda "clicked" for me during my time here is that, as developers having the ability to effectively research and problem-solve are more important than just knowing the concepts or knowing the solution to a certain problem. I have heard that on multiple occasions or heard the joke of "programmers are basically professional Googlers", but I still felt like that wasn't really the case and that programmers needed to know the language in order to be able to be successful. I know that there is still important to know key concepts, but I know realize that the ability to read code, understand what is happening in the code, and being able to use your resources and problem-solving to create a solution is more important. 

Apparently I decided to write a book in my reflections, but the TL:DR is that even though the concepts we have gone over this week haven't stuck with me yet, I know that I have the references and resources necessary to tackle this challenge head on and going through this process will help me hone skills that are important in the software development world. 

If you have read this far, thank you for taking the time to read this. Here's a star for your efforts: ðŸŒŸ!
Also thank you for always answering any questions I may have, whether in lecture, lab, or even after class. I know it is part of your job as instructors to answer questions, but it truly feels like both of you have all of our best interests at heart and genuinely care about our growth as developers. Thanks!
