I've really enjoyed the first week of capstone. It has been fun to collaborate with my teammates and work towards the same goal. We haven't really hit any hiccups once we started coding. We have made sure to always be communicating on what each of us are working on to ensure that we don't have any merge conflicts. The only hurdle that we hit up to this point was our pitch, which we got some really good feedback from, so I don't think any of us regret making the pitch on day one. It will be interesting to see how we tackle issues going forward as we get closer to wrapping up MVP tasks, but I'm sure that we will be able to handle any potential obstacles when they present themselves. I'm excited to see our end product at the end of next week.
