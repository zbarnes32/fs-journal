I think Vue is an amazing tool that I'm excited to continue using down the road, but I feel like I'm struggling to have it "click" with me, even though a lot of what we are working on this week is similar to what we have worked on in the past. I know I will get there the more we use it and that this is the first week we have used Vue, but I was frustrated with myself with my speed. I know it's not a race, so I shouldn't be worried about that, but I do feel like I missed out on practicing certain vue functionality because I didn't get further into the lab projects. Usually my speed (or lack thereof) wouldn't be a big hinderance because I would spend time after class to work on it from home, but I didn't really get to do that this week since my time was needed elsewhere. 

I'm glad that we will continue to use Vue going forward so I have more time to get familiar with it. Like I said at the top, I think Vue is an amazing tool. Not having to call a draw function twenty seven thousand times like I felt like I did on the Moon Miner checkpoint has been amazing. 

I'm a little nervous for the upcoming checkpoint since I'm feeling a little unease with Vue currently, but I'm also excited for it because it was give me more exposure to Vue which in turn will start to "click" for me.
