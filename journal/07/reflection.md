# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Even though I'm unsure if I will be able to complete the checkpoint by tomorrow, I have been enjoying this project. I'm still a little worried about my overall speed when completing tasks, but it feels good when I'm able to complete a requirement (even if I still need to heavily utilize the notes from the lecture projects). I know that my comfort level will continue to grow the more I practice. Even though my styling looks like trash at the moment, I'm excited to style it up and use this project as a portfolio piece.
